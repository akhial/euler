/**
 * Explore the possibility tree recursively, the tree for 5 is:
 *                    5
 *        4      3          2      1
 *        1    2   1      2   1    1
 *                 1      1   1    1
 *                            1    1
 *                                 1
 * The branch with root 'n' has children with roots 'n' down to 1, always including 1. If traversing a branch
 * makes us exceed the current sum 's' we backtrack. This is seen with the children of root 4 in the example above, we
 * don't traverse branches 4->4 4->3 and 4->2.
