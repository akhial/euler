/**
 * This checks all even numbers under 1000000 for the maximum (all odd numbers have larger totients because they are
 * relatively prime to all smaller even numbers).
 * It uses Euler's product formula to compute Euler's totient function, it states that:
 *  phi(n) = n*(1/1-p)*(1/1-q)*...*(1/1-z) where p,q,...,z are the prime factors of n
 * eg:
 *  phi(10) = phi(2*5) = 10*(1-1/2)*(1-1/5) = 10*0.4 = 4
 *
 *  Uses [PrimeFactors] to get the prime factors.
 *  Further reading: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_totient_function
