 * The closest fractions (n/d) to 3/7 are the fractions with the largest d and n = trunc(d*3/7).
 *
 * Start at d = 1000000 and, going down, Find the largest n for each that satisfies n/d < 3/7 and gcd(n,d) = 1.
 * The largest fraction is 428570/999997 which is very close to the trivial 428571/1000000 (a non-proper fraction).
