/**
 * My initial approach was similar to problem 81, just added the direction r - 1 (up) and tweaked the stop condition
 * (reach the end column). This causes an infinite loop because to explore down you need to explore up and vice-versa.
 *
 * The fix was to track all moves taken prior to reaching the current location in array [v], this fills [v] with
 * a "snake" of set values. Similar to an actual game of snake, if the next move causes you to intersect yourself (the
 * string of locations you passed) then you consider that cell to be a "wall" (returning [Int.MAX_VALUE]).
 *
 * However, this lead to another problem. When using memoization and filling up [m] with the intermediate results,
 * you may put in [m] a value that wasn't the result of a "full" exploration, meaning that you've skipped exploring
 * a direction (in my case the 'up' direction) because you came from it. This fills [m] with wrong values.
 * To fix this I added the [f] flag which is flipped if we skip a direction. This tells us not to log the result in [m]
 * and to wait until we come from a different direction (in my case the 'down' direction) that allows us fully explore
 * the cell.
