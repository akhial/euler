My solutions to the math problems on Project Euler. All solutions include an explanation at the top.

You can find the problems in the [Project Euler Archive](https://projecteuler.net/archives), 
you can also download a text file containing the first 476 problems at Kyle Keen's 
[Local Euler](https://github.com/davidcorbin/euler-offline) project.
